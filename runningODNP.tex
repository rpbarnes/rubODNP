\section{Introduction}
This document attempts to explain how to run the ODNP experiment on the setup at Ruhr Universitat Bochum.

\section{Observed Bugs with Xepr}
Yes this software blows, however it's what we have to deal with so we must get through it.

On a side note being Xepr is buggy it is very possible / simple to utilize the auxillary output of the microwave bridge and circumvent the use of Xepr for the ODNP experiment. In this context you would just configure the aux microwave output to go through a digital attenuator (seperately purchased) then go to the Bruker solid state amplifier. Here you could use a raspberry pi to set the attenuation of the attenuator and to trigger the solid state amplifier. \fc{This setup would free the ODNP experiment from Xepr, which if Xepr continues to be as buggy as it is now I think this might be a necessary thing to do! Also if you're reading this and thinking WTF? just send Ryan Barnes a mail :).}

Here I just list a collection of observed bugs that I've noticed and how I've dealt with them in the past. When you observe something that prohibits you from running an experiment there is a chance that I've observed the same bug and have listed a way to deal with it 


\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Tuning window is unresponsive and shows a flat line:} I find that when I close and reopen the Xepr software the tuning window no longer responds to commands and shows a flat line, uncharacteristic of the microwave transmission line. \fc{To fix this, I close the software; I turn off the spectrometer and wait a couple seconds then turn the spectrometer back on; I then reopen the software. Now I can see the tuning dip.}

\item {\bf The green button on the console does not stay in:} It seems if you leave the power supply on and the console off for any extended period of time the breaker throws and power is not delivered to the console. \fc{To fix this go to the back of the power supply and flip the switch that is pointing down. This will turn the power to the console back on, once this occurs you can press the green button}

\item {\bf XeprAPI does not initialize in the server:} The server fails to open because the XeprAPI does not find an xepr instance. \fc{To fix this you must go into xepr and enable the XeprAPI. Go Processing -> XeprAPI -> click Enable. The server should now work.}
